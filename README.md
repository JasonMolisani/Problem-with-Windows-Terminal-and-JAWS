# Problem-with-Windows-Terminal-and-JAWS

This is a simple project created to as basically as possible reproduce the
problem I was experiencing with JAWS not reading the output in Windows
Terminal. This is used as the example for the 
[issue]([url](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/15382)) written
on that project.
